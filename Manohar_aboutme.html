          <h3>Career Goals</h3>   It all started with a passion for coding back
          when I was nine years old. Now I strive to be a physicist, particularly
          a Quantum Physicists and a Quantum Computer Engineer. To accomplish this,
          I plan on going to an engineering college after I am done with high school
          in hopes of getting a masters degree or higher in computer science. I want to
          pursue this field because I want to crack all the mysteries that the universe
          has given us and make sense of our reality. <br><br> <h3>  My Strengths/Work Skills</h3>
          I am a really calm person, and I never crack under pressure. I have developed this trait
          a lot through my school experience, with all the tests and challenging assignments that
          I have taken. I am also a team player, as I never ignore anyone who comes to me asking
          for help, and I always communicate with my team members and peers. I obtained this trait
          with the clubs that I have taken, like Badminton and Science Olympiad, where communication
          decides how well you compete as a team. It is essential to know and tell everything that the
          team needs to know. This is a valuable skill And lastly, I am persistent, as I never give up
          on anything that I have set my eyes on, no matter how much time or effort it takes. This trait
          comes from everyday life. Everyone has his or her ups and downs during life, and it cannot be
          avoided, so it is important that you push through the struggle.  <br><br> <h3>My Achievements</h3>
          I have had Principal's Honor Roll throughout middle school and in high school as well. I
          have won numerous medals for Science Olympiad. <br>I have programmed websites, games
          and apps. I have certification in Python, and Web Development. Recently as of 2019, I have
          developed multiple Python nueral network programs. <br> <br> <br>
          In conclusion, my goal is to have a career where I work with computers and
          people. I thank you for your time, and feel free to contact me and explore
          the rest of the website.
